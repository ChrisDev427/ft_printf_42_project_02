# ft_printf_42_project_02
The ft_printf project at École 42 involves creating a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language.
The printf function is widely used to format and print data in various formats, such as strings, numbers, and other data types.

The main objective of the project is to develop a versatile and efficient ft_printf function that supports a subset of
the format specifiers and modifiers available in the standard printf function. Students are required to implement the
core functionality of formatting and printing data based on the provided format string.

Students need to handle a variety of format specifiers, such as %s for strings, %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers,
and more. They also need to support various modifiers, such as field width, precision, and flag options.

The ft_printf function must be able to handle a variable number of arguments using variadic functions and parse the format string
to determine the data types and modifiers for each argument. Students must then format the data accordingly and output it to the console or a file stream.

The project also emphasizes code organization, modularity, and error handling. Students are encouraged to write clean, efficient,
and well-documented code that can handle various edge cases and error scenarios.

In summary, the ft_printf project at École 42 involves implementing a custom version of the printf function in C.
It challenges students to handle various format specifiers and modifiers, support variable arguments, and output formatted data.
This project enhances their understanding of string manipulation, formatting, and variadic functions in C.
